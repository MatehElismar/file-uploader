# file-uploader
At the begining, this is a module made for making easier to upload a huge amount of properly organized files to a server .


To do this we need.

- A file system library to look into the folder/files you are working on.
- A HTTP / HTTPS Client to make the post request to the specified server
- The Files Structure (JSON) : This is the way the files are organized and how the user wants the app look for those files.
